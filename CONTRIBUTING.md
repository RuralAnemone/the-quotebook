## formatting:

quotes should conform to the following structure:

```md
context, if necessary:

> quote 1

\- quoted person

context can also go down here

---

context, if necessary:

> quote 2.1

\- person 1

> quote 2.2

\- person 2

> quote 2.3

\- person 1

context can also go down here

---

```

<details><summary>...which looks like this</summary>

context, if necessary:

> quote 1

\- quoted person

context can also go down here

---

context, if necessary:

> quote 2.1

\- person 1

> quote 2.2

\- person 2

> quote 2.3

\- person 1

context can also go down here

</details>
